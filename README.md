# AzureDigitalTwinsBackend

This project is a first web application that help you undestand how to take advantage of [Azure Digital Twins](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/digital-twins/) using a simple ASP.NET Core application.

We are not trying to implement another end user web application like the [Smart Hotel 360](https://github.com/Microsoft/SmartHotel360-IoT).
You will have in your hands a backend application to simply the way you use the Azure Digital Twins APIs for:
- browsing ontologies, creating types and properties (To be added soon)
- navigating in your space graph, creating, editing or deleting nodes
- managing devices, sensors and unser defined functions associated to your space nodes
- simulating devices and sending data
- creating spaces, devices, sensors in batch mode using a Yaml script
- more to come (RoleAssigment, Space Blob, ...)

Please use the [Issues](https://github.com/garolion/AzureDigitalTwinsBackend/issues) section to ask for new features
